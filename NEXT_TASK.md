## P1.8: v0.1 publication destinations and release

MIT licensing and the `chrome-bridge-mcp` Python distribution/CLI name are selected and applied. Reproducible extension ZIP, wheel, and sdist builds and clean E2E are complete locally and in CI. Chrome Web Store is selected as the extension distribution channel, starting Unlisted with deferred publishing. Finalize the remaining repository and publication setup.

- Decide the Git remote, repository visibility, authority to create tags/releases, and whether to publish the wheel/sdist to a package index.
- Confirm that the `chrome-bridge-mcp` project name can be registered at the selected package index, then configure trusted publishing if needed.
- After selecting publication destinations, implement upload of CI-verified artifacts and a GitHub Release for tag `v0.1.0`.
- Register and verify the Chrome Web Store developer account, then publish `PRIVACY.md`, the product page, and a monitored support destination at stable HTTPS URLs.
- Produce the required Store screenshot and 440×280 promotional image using only controlled fixture data. Complete listing text, privacy declarations, permission justifications, and reviewer instructions from `docs/chrome-web-store.md`.
- Make the server installable to reviewers through PyPI or a public GitHub Release, upload the same verified extension ZIP as Unlisted, and submit with deferred publishing.
- Confirm matching `SHA256SUMS` between the tag build and a local rebuild, notices/licenses in release assets, a fresh install, and a branded-Chrome manual smoke test.
- After Store approval, disable the unpacked copy before testing the Store installation, then verify connection, inactive-tab operation, stable Store ID across update, and rollback before publishing or considering Public visibility.
- Do not publish artifacts to third parties until the remote, visibility, release authority, package-index destination, Store publisher account, and public privacy/support URLs are explicitly configured.
